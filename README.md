## Greetings! Welcome to my Github!

## About me

I am a student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville studying Geographic Information Science and Technologies. My main research focuses are centered around terrain analysis and remote sensing. 

## Research Interests

My current primary research focus is on the rapid coastal erosion, land loss, and terrain changes happening in the Outer Banks island chain off the Eastern Shore of the United States. I have also worked on research in other coaststal regions studying coastal treeline recession and the effects.
